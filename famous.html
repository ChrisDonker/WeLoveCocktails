                        <p> "The Negroni was invented at Caffe Casoni in Florence, Italy in 1919.
                            Count Camillo Negroni asked the bartender, Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen the Americano.
                            Negroni told Scarselli to add gin to his Americano instead of soda water and to replace the lemon garnish with an orange garnish.
                            Negroni fell in love with his creation and it soon became one of the most popular drinks in Italy.
                            Negroni’s family took advantage of the drink’s popularity and created the Negroni Distillery in Treviso, Italy.
                            The distillery produced a ready-made version of the drink and is still open today."

                            However, there is a popular belief that the drink was created by Dr. Iain Marshall for a banquet in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden.
                            The drink became a hit by the end of the night and people from that banquet began to order it at other clubs and bars.
                            They would ask servers for the “Manhattan” which was the name of the club where the banquet took place."

                        <p> "There are different theories on who invented the mojito.
                            Some believe it was created in the 19th century by African slaves who worked in the Cuban sugarcane fields.
                            Others say that it was created by Naval Officer Sir Francis Drake while he was in Cuba.
                            What we do know is that mojitos began to gain popularity in Havana, Cuba in the 1900s and it’s now one of the most popular cocktails in the world."
