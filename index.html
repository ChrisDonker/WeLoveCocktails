                    <h2 >Where does this love come from?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To be honest the passion I got for cocktails didn't originate from me, but from a mate of mine. 
                        He started to experiment with the differents kinds of liqours and ways to put them together.
                        But for one to experiment, one also needs a test rabbit to know if it is a good cocktail or not.
                        That is where I come in.

                    <h2>Drunk too many times?</h2>
                    <p>
                        For a test rabbit as myself, a test moment wouldn't just be a moment to test 1 new recipe.
                        No no no, on such occasion i would be bombarded with a bunch of new recipes to try.
                        But this moments are still really fun, for as the bartender gets drunk with you.
                        So to say if at this moment i wouldn't be in love with these drinks, i would after what comes
                        next.

                    <p>
                        Up at the moment of testing only a few evenings getting wasted.
                        Not much later after my mate becoming a bartender at the best cocktailbar in Utrecht.
                        The occasional free drink, and crazy stories of his colleagues.
                        But to see where the spark of cocktail love electrified me.
                        I will tell you a crazy story.

                    <h2>This love = opportunity!</h2>
                    <p>
                        While on a way in the far lands of Austria, we encountered an opportunity.
                        A Burger Boutique that wanted to sell high quality cocktails, got my mate and I as their
                        customers.
                        After a good conversation, we made a deal to give them a workshop.
                        And without them knowing a newly designed menu.
                        So i my mates way of his soon to be proffesion, and my way of way design.
                        I totally fell in love with these magical drinks.
